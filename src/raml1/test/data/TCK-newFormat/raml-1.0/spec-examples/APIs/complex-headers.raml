# tags: headers, traits, override, examples

title: Example with headers
traits:
  chargeable:
    headers:
      X-Dept:
        type: array
        description: |
          A department code to be charged.
          Multiple of such headers are allowed.
        items:
          pattern: ^\d+\-\w+$
          example: 230-OCTO
  traceable:
    headers:
      X-Tracker:
        description: A code to track API calls end to end
        pattern: ^\w{16}$
        example: abcdefghijklmnop
/users:
  get:
    is: [ chargeable, traceable ]
    description: |
      The HTTP interaction will look like

      GET /users HTTP/1.1
      X-Dept: 18-FINANCE
      X-Dept: 200-MISC
      X-Tracker: gfr456d03ygh38s2
    headers:
      X-Dept:
        example: [ 18-FINANCE, 200-MISC ]
      X-Tracker:
        example: gfr456d03ygh38s2
