  in many situations, you may not need to authenticate users at all.
  For instance, you may request popular photos without authenticating
  (i.e. you do not need to provide an access_token; just use your client ID with your request).
  We only require authentication in cases where your application is making requests on behalf of a user
  (commenting, liking, browsing a user's feed, etc.).
